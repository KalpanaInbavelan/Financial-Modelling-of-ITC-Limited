**ITC FINANCIAL MODELLING PROJECT**

**1. Company Profile & History**
1. ITC Ltd., established in **1910**, is one of India’s largest diversified conglomerates operating across **FMCG, cigarettes, hotels, paperboards, packaging, and agribusiness**.
2. The company has built a strong market presence with **stable revenues exceeding ₹70,000 crore (FY25)** and a reputation for consistent dividend payouts.
3. ITC follows an asset-light, cash-generative business model with **very low debt (Debt–Equity ≈ 0.07%)**, making it financially resilient.

**2. Recent Demerger Activity & Market Capitalisation Impact**
1. The **demerger of ITC Hotels** created a separate listed hospitality entity, allowing ITC to focus on its high-margin FMCG and core businesses.
2. Post-demerger, ITC’s **capital allocation efficiency improved**, as non-core assets were separated from cash-generating segments.
3. This restructuring strengthened **investor confidence and market capitalisation**, driven by clearer valuation visibility and improved return metrics.

**3. Financial Statement Analysis**
1. **Revenue grew from ₹36,583 crore (FY16) to ₹69,324 crore (FY25)**, reflecting steady long-term growth despite short-term volatility.
2. **EBITDA margins remained strong at ~35–38%**, indicating efficient cost control and pricing power.
3. **Net profit increased from ₹7,561 crore to ₹16,001 crore**, supported by strong operating leverage and stable tax rates.

**4. Ratio Analysis**
1. **Profitability ratios** showed high efficiency, with **ROE ~19–24%** and **ROCE ~28–33%**, outperforming many industry peers.
2. **Liquidity and solvency ratios** remained strong, with extremely high **interest coverage (>300x)** due to minimal borrowings.
3. **Efficiency ratios**, such as inventory and debtor turnover, reflected effective working capital management and short cash conversion cycles.

**5. Common Size Statements**
1. Common-size income statements revealed **raw material costs averaging ~44–47% of sales**, while selling and administrative expenses declined over time.
2. Net profit consistently accounted for **22–26% of sales**, indicating margin stability across business cycles.
3. Common-size balance sheets showed **reserves forming over 80% of total liabilities**, highlighting ITC’s equity-driven capital structure.

**6. Beta Regression Calculation*
1. **Beta was calculated using 2-year weekly returns**, regressing ITC stock returns against NIFTY market returns.
2. The **raw beta of ~0.47** indicated lower volatility compared to the broader market.
3. After adjusting for capital structure, the **levered beta was estimated at ~0.52**, reflecting ITC’s low systematic risk profile.

**7. WACC Calculation**
1. **Cost of equity was calculated at ~15.23%** using CAPM, with a risk-free rate of **6.60%** and market risk premium of **~16.68%**.
2. **Post-tax cost of debt was ~3.86%**, reflecting ITC’s low borrowing cost and tax shield benefits.
3. Based on target capital structure weights, **WACC was estimated at ~13.70%**, serving as the discount rate for valuation.

**8. Financial Forecasting**
1. Sales were forecasted to grow at **~4–5% CAGR**, reaching approximately **₹97,700 crore by FY31**.
2. EBITDA was projected to grow steadily, maintaining margins around **33–35%**, driven by operating efficiency.

3. Using the formula *Intrinsic Growth Rate = Reinvestment Rate × ROIC*, ITC’s **sustainable intrinsic growth was estimated at ~4–5%**, achievable without increasing leverage.
